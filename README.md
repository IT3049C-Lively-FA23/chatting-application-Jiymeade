how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 20/20

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I believe I did good, though  the placement of where the new added stuff actually counted. So, for example, if i added something and It wasn't in the right place. My screen will tuen back to its original state but not retain any of the information or send the message being asked. 

### How long it took me to finish this?
The html and Java took me a day, though sometimes I forgot adding to the js like buttons or functions need to mean also adding to the html for the fuction/action to actually work. 

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
The bootstrap `display-4` makes the heading have a larger font size. Which for example can be classified as a way of making the text prominent in its display like a main title or a headline in magazines.
