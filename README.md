how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 20/20

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I blame my lack of knowing and recognizing when I spell something wrong. Coding plans are put to recongnize the bigger goal and then not messing up the most small details. You spell something wrong or you forget a ` ` then automatically you wont get the right results. Even if you have soemthing coded right like the submit button, if it doesn't work it might not be the submit button fault like I thought. Coding and I have a love and hate relationship. 

### How long it took me to finish this?
